Git 2.25 Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.24
-------------------

Backward compatibility notes


UI, Workflows & Features

 * A tutorial on object enumeration has been added.

 * The branch description ("git branch --edit-description") has been
   used to fill the body of the cover letters by the format-patch
   command; this has been enhanced so that the subject can also be
   filled.

 * "git rebase --preserve-merges" has been marked as deprecated; this
   release stops advertising it in the "git rebase -h" output.

 * The code to generate multi-pack index learned to show (or not to
   show) progress indicators.

 * "git apply --3way" learned to honor merge.conflictStyle
   configuration variable, like merges would.
